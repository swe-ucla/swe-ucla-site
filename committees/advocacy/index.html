              <p>
                The Advocacy Committee serves as the vocal chord both on- and off-campus for SWE-UCLA. Our mission is to (you guessed it)
                <i>advocate</i> for the inclusion and success of underrepresented communities across STEM––particularly women in engineering.
                We do so through a series of quarterly events, all of which lead up to our flagship
                <a href="/events/epec">Engineers for Professional Equality Conference</a>.

              <p>
                This year, the Advocacy Committee wants to expand its outreach across campus and begin voicing our concerns to members
                across the LA and broader California community. We hope to do so through a <i>three-pronged approach</i>:

                    Highlighting intersectionality:
                  </i>
                  Many women in engineering face difficulties entering their respective fields because their identities encompass more than one
                  underrepresented demographic in STEM. This year we want to make it our duty to spread awareness about this diversity and discuss
                  solutions to the difficulties one may face because of their supposed “untraditional” background. </br>

                    Destigmatizing issues surrounding mental health and wellness:
                  </i>
                  The first step in advocating for our women is to ensure a solid foundation built on self-confidence and a healthy desire to
                  grow––both as individuals and members of our broader global community. Raising awareness about the obstacles one may face as she
                  embarks upon her journey as an engineer is critical to ensuring her success in the future.</br>

                  </i>
                  Our job as members of SWE is not only to embolden engineers currently pursuing their degrees in STEM, but also to pave the way
                  for female engineers to come. Over the course of the next year and a half, we hope to work with local assembly members and
                  members of Congress to allocate funding and introduce programs to diversify the STEM world and unleash even more potential.

                  guidance and support from someone who has already experienced the very things she may be going through––academically,
                  intellectually, and, most importantly, developmentally.</br>
